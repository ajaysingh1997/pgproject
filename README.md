# PG PROJECT ON FOOD DELIVERY TIME PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

In the modern era of digital convenience, online food delivery platforms
have revolutionized the way people access their favorite meals. However, one
common challenge faced by both customers and service providers is the
uncertainty surrounding delivery times. Customers often expect timely and
predictable deliveries, while restaurants and delivery services strive to meet these
expectations efficiently. The objective of food delivery time prediction is to
accurately estimate the time it will take for a food order to be prepared, packaged,
and delivered to the customer after they place an order through a food delivery
platform or restaurant. This prediction helps manage customer expectations and
improve overall user experience.

WHY THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE SOLVED?

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION : Accurate delivery time predictions enhance customer satisfaction. When customers have a clear idea of when their food will arrive they can 
                       plan their schedules accordingly. This reduces anxiety and frustration caused by uncertain wait times, leading to happier customers who 
                       are more likely to become repeat buyers.
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: Delivery services can optimize their operations based on accurate predictions. Knowing how long it takes to deliver an order allows them 
                        to allocate resources efficiently, manage delivery fleets, and coordinate with restaurants to ensure timely order preparation. This, in
                        turn, reduces the risk of delays and improves overall service quality.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: In a competitive market, businesses that provide accurate delivery time estimates gain a competitive edge. Customers are more likely to 
                       choose a service that can reliably provide them with a clear idea of when their food will arrive, which can lead to increased customer
                       loyalty and market share.
DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS: Collecting and analyzing delivery time data can provide valuable insights into peak delivery hours, delivery performance metrics, and 
                      customer behavior. This information can guide strategic  decisions, marketing efforts, and business growth
