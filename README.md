# PG PROJECT ON FOOD DELIVERY TIME PRDEICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

In the modern era of digital convenience, online food delivery platforms
have revolutionized the way people access their favorite meals. However, one
common challenge faced by both customers and service providers is the
uncertainty surrounding delivery times. Customers often expect timely and
predictable deliveries, while restaurants and delivery services strive to meet these
expectations efficiently. The objective of food delivery time prediction is to
accurately estimate the time it will take for a food order to be prepared, packaged,
and delivered to the customer after they place an order through a food delivery
platform or restaurant. This prediction helps manage customer expectations and
improve overall user experience.
